# Coherent sampling approximate input frequency calculation

CohSam.m is a matlab script.

FFT_point is the Sample points number, Fsample is the Sample frepuency, Fin is approximate test frequency.

Two Excel files will be generated in the folder where the script is located. Fcin.xlsx contains the actual test frequencies.
